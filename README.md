# Dynamics365WebAPI
This is a template to use the Dynamics 365 Web API written in C# .NET 6.0. It's a wrapper API to communicate between some external software and Dynamics 365 
CRM. It doesn't use the nuget package for .NET core, but instead directly makes REST calls to Dynamics 365.

You can authenticate with an app registration in the Azure cloud since this is made specifically for Dynamics 365 Power Apps online.
